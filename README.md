Hi, my name is Simon. I created this repository for my Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research course, however, it will be useful for showcasing how I think the importance of computer science in the life sciences disciplines should be recognized.
I want to learn programming so that I can elevate projects with code, automation, logic, and AI that would otherwise forgo computational potential like much of the current research in pharmaceutical sciences.
So far I've been learning how to use Markdown, R, and Python. I've also developed personal ways to make the most out of new tools like prompt engineering for GPT-4, home automation and finance in Python.
